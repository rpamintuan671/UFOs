# UFO Sightings

![](static/images/Header%20photo.png)

## Overview of the Project:

> * The purpose of the project is to create a webpage with dynamic table of UFO sightings which will allow users to filter multiple criteria at the same time. Users will be able to filter for city, state, country and shape.



## Results:
> * Below is a website's filter search screenshot. Users can choose to enter date, city, state, country and shape. Once entered, it will filter the data within the search parameters.

If user enters "ca", it will show all the sightings within CA only.

## Summary:

### Drawbacks:
> * The drawback to this webpage is we have limited data provided to use when filtering our search therefore it would be wiser to use a drop down search to filter outcome. 

If user search in the state of "NV", there will be no output because there's no data provided of any sightings in the state of NV.

### Recommendations:
> * If users are not aware that the available data is limited to few states then their search will be zero. I would recommend to grab more data and add a dropdown choices on filter search box.
